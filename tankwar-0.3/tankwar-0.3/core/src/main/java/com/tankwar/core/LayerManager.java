/**
 * The LayerManager manages a series of Layers. The LayerManager simplifies the
 * process of rendering the Layers that have been added to it by automatically
 * rendering the correct regions of each Layer in the appropriate order. The
 * LayerManager maintains an ordered list to which Layers can be appended,
 * inserted and removed. A Layer's index correlates to its z-order; the layer
 * at index 0 is closest to the user while a the Layer with the highest index
 * is furthest away from the user. The indices are always contiguous; that is,
 * if a Layer is removed, the indices of subsequent Layers will be adjusted to
 * maintain continuity. The LayerManager class provides several features that
 * control how the game's Layers are rendered on the screen. The view window
 * controls the size of the visible region and its position relative to
 * the LayerManager's coordinate system. Changing the position of the view
 * window enables effects such as scrolling or panning the user's view.
 * For example, to scroll to the right, simply move the view window's
 * location to the right. The size of the view window controls how large
 * the user's view will be, and is usually fixed at a size that is appropriate
 * for the device's screen.
